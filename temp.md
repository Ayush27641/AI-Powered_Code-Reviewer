**Errors:**

* Undeclared variables `a` and `b`.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* Pass `a` and `b` as arguments to the function.

**Optimized Code Version:**

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

**Additional Comments:**

* The corrected code defines a function `sum` that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum. This
resolves the original error of using undeclared variables.
